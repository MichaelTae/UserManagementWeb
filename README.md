# UserManagementWeb

This is a mockup of what an internal site could look like for managing users for a business. 

The site is built using vite + react. It uses libraries such as Mantine and also framer motion. 

The css part of the site is very techy and not really intended for production, however due to this being a project that's not supposed to be deployed I felt like doing some cool stuff.

There is no built in security as that wasn't the focus of the site. For instance the login credentials are simply admin for both password and username. 

It uses a simple API i made to go along with it https://github.com/MichaelTae/UserManagementAPI
